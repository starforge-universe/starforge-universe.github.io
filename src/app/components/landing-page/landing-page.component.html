      Welcome to <strong>StarForge Universe</strong>—the place where developers are supported with useful resources to build and grow their projects. Whether you are starting a new repo or scaling an existing one, we aim to give you the tools and structure you need.
    </p>
    <p>
      This project provides <strong>useful GitHub repository templates</strong> so you can hit the ground running with sensible defaults: CI/CD and project layout. No need to reinvent the wheel for every new repository.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beyond templates, StarForge Universe is an <strong>ecosystem to manage a complex and scalable project universe</strong>. Use it to keep many repositories consistent, maintain shared standards, and navigate a growing codebase with clear conventions and automation. Explore the templates and guides to shape your own universe.
